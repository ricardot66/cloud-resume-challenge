        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div id="mainDivOne">Cloud-Oriented Data & Analytics Professional</div>
        <br />
        <div>
       Hi, I’m a data and technology enthusiast with over 10 years of experience helping businesses turn complex data into smart, scalable solutions. My journey has taken me across markets like Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, where I’ve led analytics initiatives that drive strategy, performance, and growth.

I specialize in blending analytics, development, and project management to create tools and systems that actually solve problems. Whether it’s building data pipelines, designing pricing models, or diving into Python and SQL to streamline operations—I love creating solutions that are both technically sound and business-relevant.
<br /><br />
Lately, I’ve been focusing on cloud technologies (AWS, GCP) and exploring how they can power the next generation of analytics. I'm especially excited about the potential of cloud computing in healthcare and public good—fields where data can truly make a difference.

Outside of work, I’m always learning—currently diving deeper into cloud development, healthcare analytics, and how to build meaningful tech products.

If you’re into data, tech, or building things that matter, we’ll probably get along.

        <h1>About This Website</h1>
        <div id="mainDivTwo">Made with Cloud in Mind.</div>
        <br />
        <div>
            This website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), leveraging a modern and scalable cloud architecture and meant as an cloud computing exercise based on The Cloud Resume Challenge Guidebook by Forrest Brazeal. Here's a peek behind the scenes:

            <br /> <b>Static Hosting</b>: The site is hosted using Amazon S3, ensuring fast, reliable, and cost-effective delivery of static content.
            <br /><b>Content Delivery</b>: To improve global performance and reduce latency, CloudFront serves as the Content Delivery Network (CDN), caching assets closer to visitors.
            <br /><b>Secure Browsing</b>: The site uses SSL encryption to protect your connection, ensuring secure data transmission.
            <br /><b>Custom Domain</b>: The domain is managed via GoDaddy, configured to point to the CloudFront distribution.
            <br /><b>Visitor Counter</b>: A simple and serverless visitor counter tracks visits in real time. 
            
<br /> <b>Serverless</b>: A Lambda function that updates and retrieves visit counts.
API Gateway acting as the interface between the website and backend services.
A DynamoDB table that stores the visitor count data.
This architecture enables high performance, scalability, and a fully serverless backend—optimized for both developers and visitors alike.

            <ul class="key_points">
                As RGM Market Manager for the Canadian, Brazilian, Mexican, and Chilean markets, I lead the development and implementation of predictive and descriptive analytics tools to support strategic decisions in pricing, customer investment, and assortment.

I design and develop data pipelines to enhance the robustness and scalability of our models, contributing to cleaner, more reliable data flows across markets. This includes hands-on work with data transformation, cleansing, and enrichment to ensure high-quality inputs for machine learning and statistical models.

I also champion cross-market enablement by promoting and coordinating Revenue Growth Management learning sessions, driving analytics adoption and capability building across the organization.

This role has sharpened my ability to deliver scalable data solutions with a strong business impact, while collaborating with both technical teams and commercial stakeholders. It has also laid a solid foundation for my ongoing transition into cloud development and data engineering.
